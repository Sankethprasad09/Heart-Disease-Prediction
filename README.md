# Heart-Disease-Prediction
ðŸ«€ We will utilize machine learning models to estimate the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease, based on features such as cholesterol levels and chest pain type. A sample dataset will be used for the purpose of exploring different machine learning algorithms and understanding their implementation.
